They were introduced by Hochreiter &amp;amp; Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work. They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.</description></item><item><title>Illustrated Guide to LSTM's and GRU's: A step by step Explanation</title><link>https://oyzg.github.io/archives/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 22:17:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://oyzg.github.io/archives/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation/</guid><description>In this post, we’ll start with the intuition behind LSTM ’s and GRU’s. Then I’ll explain the internal mechanisms that allow LSTM’s and GRU’s to perform so well. If you want to understand what’s happening under the hood for these two networks, then this post is for you.</description></item></channel></rss>
