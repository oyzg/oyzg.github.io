draft: false
categories: [Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing]
series: []
tags: [LSTM, gradient vanishing]
summary: "LSTMs solve the problem using a unique additive gradient structure that includes direct access to the forget gateâ€™s activations, enabling the network to encourage desired behaviour from the error gradient using frequent gates update on every time step of the learning process."
