categories: [Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing]
series: []
tags: [word2vec, cbow, skip-gram, word embedding]
summary: "Word2Vec is not a singular algorithm, rather, it is a family of model architectures and optimizations that can be used to learn word embeddings from large datasets. Embeddings learned through Word2Vec have proven to be successful on a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks."
