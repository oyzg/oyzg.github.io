summary: "In this article, I will try to give a fairly simple and understandable explanation of one really fascinating type of neural network. Introduced by Cho, et al. in 2014, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) aims to solve the vanishing gradient problem which comes with a standard recurrent neural network."
