I gathered some valuable resources or websites from the Internet, including courses, websites, and anything about Machine Learning or Data Science that I had read or used.

## Free Courses

- [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) It's a Google's fast-paced, practical introduction to Machine Learning.
- [NLP series Course In Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvOO0btloRnuTUGN4XqO85eKPeFSZsEqK) Its content includes text preprocessing, word embedding, RNN/LSTM, seq2seq model, and attention/self-attention mechanism.
- [Audio Signal Processing for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNqIee7cH3q1bh4QJFAaeNv0) An awesome course about audio processing for machine learning.

## Discussions and Questions

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is the world's largest data science community with powerful tools and resources.
- [Learn AI Together](https://discord.com/invite/cUSQaBSwxQ) is a group chat about artificial intelligence in Discord.
- [Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning) , [Learn Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/) are communities about machine learning in Reddit.

## Libraries and Tools

- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is a free machine learning library. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN.
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) is a library for building Python programs to work with human language data. It has many useful tools like text tokenization, word lemmatization, and so on.
- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora.

## Online Labs

- [Embedding Projector](http://projector.tensorflow.org/) is a tool for visualizing high-dimensional data. The website has an example that shows how word2vec looks like.

## Datasets

- [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/) is a large database of sentences and translations. Its content is ever-growing and results from the voluntary contributions of thousands of members.

## Others

- [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) is a navigation of Machine Learning papers, Code, Dataset, and their leaderboards.
