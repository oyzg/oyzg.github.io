You will work with the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset hosted on Kaggle. The aim is to detect a mere 492 fraudulent transactions from 284,807 transactions in total. You will use Keras to define the model and class weights to help the model learn from the imbalanced data.</description></item></channel></rss>
